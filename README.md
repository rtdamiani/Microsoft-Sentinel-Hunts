Hunts Menu in Microsoft Sentinel — Summary

The Hunts menu in Microsoft Sentinel is the dedicated space for proactive threat investigation within the environment. It allows analysts to create and run custom KQL queries to identify suspicious behavior, such as activities related to malware, ransomware, lateral movement, unusual access patterns, or any indicators of compromise.
Within Hunts, you can:

- Create custom queries to investigate attack hypotheses or abnormal behaviors.
- Run these queries on demand to validate suspicions or deepen investigations.
- Save and reuse hunts, enabling them to be executed again whenever needed.
- Schedule periodic executions, turning manual investigations into continuous detection processes.
- Review historical results, making it easier to analyze trends and correlate findings with other security events.
